          <p>Atomic force microscopy is an extremely versatile technique, featuring atomic-scale imaging resolution, and also offering the possibility to probe interaction forces down to few pN. Recently, this technique has been specialized to study the interaction between single living cells, one on the substrate, and a second being adhered on the cantilever. Cell&#8211;cell force spectroscopy offers a unique tool to investigate in fine detail intra-cellular interactions, and it holds great promise to elucidate elusive phenomena in physiology and pathology. Here we present a systematic study of the effect of the main measurement parameters on cell&#8211;cell curves, showing the importance of controlling the experimental conditions. Moreover, a simple theoretical interpretation is proposed, based on the number of contacts formed between the two interacting cells. The results show that single cell&#8211;cell force spectroscopy experiments carry a wealth of information that can be exploited to understand the inner dynamics of the interaction of living cells at the molecular level.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.3390/s21041069" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>A low-cost device for registration-free quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) based on the transport of intensity equation of cells in continuous flow is presented. The method uses acoustic focusing to align cells into a single plane where all cells move at a constant speed. The acoustic focusing plane is tilted with respect to the microscope&#8217;s focal plane in order to obtain cell images at multiple focal positions. As the cells are displaced at constant speed, phase maps can be generated without the need to segment and register individual objects. The proposed inclined geometry allows for the acquisition of a vertical stack without the need for any moving part, and it enables a cost-effective and robust implementation of QPM. The suitability of the solution for biological imaging is tested on blood samples, demonstrating the ability to recover the phase map of single red blood cells flowing through the microchip.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1063/5.0036585" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Mesenchymal stem cells represent an important resource, for bone regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications. This review focuses on new advancements and biophysical tools which exploit different physical and chemical markers of mesenchymal stem cell populations, to finely characterize phenotype changes along their osteogenic differentiation process. Special attention is paid to recently developed label-free methods, which allow monitoring cell populations with minimal invasiveness. Among them, quantitative phase imaging, suitable for single-cell morphometric analysis, and nanoindentation, functional to cellular biomechanics investigation. Moreover, the pool of ion channels expressed in cells during differentiation is discussed, with particular interest for calcium homoeostasis. Altogether, a biophysical perspective of osteogenesis is proposed, offering a valuable tool for the assessment of the cell stage, but also suggesting potential physiological links between apparently independent phenomena.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-020-09569-7" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>The human mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is gated by membrane tension and regulates essential biological processes such as vascular development and erythrocyte volume homeostasis. Currently, little is known about PIEZO1 plasma membrane localization and organization. Using a PIEZO1-GFP fusion protein, we investigated whether cholesterol enrichment or depletion by methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and disruption of membrane cholesterol organization by dynasore affects PIEZO1-GFP&#8217;s response to mechanical force. Electrophysiological recordings in the cell-attached configuration revealed that MBCD caused a rightward shift in the PIEZO1-GFP pressure&#8211;response curve, increased channel latency in response to mechanical stimuli, and markedly slowed channel inactivation. The same effects were seen in native PIEZO1 in N2A cells. STORM superresolution imaging revealed that, at the nanoscale, PIEZO1-GFP channels in the membrane associate as clusters sensitive to membrane manipulation. Both cluster distribution and diffusion rates were affected by treatment with MBCD (5 mM). Supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids appeared to sensitize the PIEZO1-GFP response to applied pressure. Together, our results indicate that PIEZO1 function is directly dependent on the membrane composition and lateral organization of membrane cholesterol domains, which coordinate the activity of clustered PIEZO1 channels.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201912515" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Microalgae play a key role in aquatic ecology, and methods providing species determination and enumeration can provide critical information about&#8212;for instance&#8212;harmful algae blooms (HABs) or spreading of invasive species. A crucial step in current methods is the use of sedimentation. This provides the enrichment needed to achieve statistical counts of sometimes rare species within reasonable timeframes, but it comes with the drawback of aggregating the sample. This is a real challenge for computer-aided identification as particle aggregates&#160;can often be erroneously classified. In this paper, we propose an alternative method based on flow-through imaging aided by acoustic-focussing, as this provides better input-data for automated counting-methods while simultaneously removing the need for manual sample preparation. We demonstrate that by acoustically focussing microalgae and other particulates in a fast-flowing water sample, it is possible to analyse up to 8&#160;mL sample per minute with sufficient image quality to discriminate the invasive species&#160;<i>Ostreopsis ovata</i>&#160;from other particulates in samples taken directly from the Mediterranean. We also showcase the ability to achieve sharp images in flow-through at magnifications up to &#215;&#8201;50.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01907-5" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>For the first time, we report a correspondence between microplastics (MP) ingestion and ecotoxicological effects in gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidarian jellyfish). The ephyra stage of the jellyfish&#160;<i>Aurelia</i>&#160;sp. was exposed to both environmental and high concentrations of fluorescent 1&#8211;4&#160;&#956;m polyethylene MP (0.01&#8211;10&#160;mg/L). After 24 and 48&#160;h, MP accumulation, acute (Immobility) and behavioral (Frequency pulsation) endpoints were investigated. MP were detected by confocal and tomographic investigations on gelatinous body and mouth, either attached on the surface or ingested. This interaction was responsible for impairing ephyrae survival and behavior at all tested concentrations after 24&#160;h. Acute and behavioral effects were also related to mechanical disturbance, caused by MP, triggering a loss of radial symmetry. Contaminated ephyrae exposed to clean seawater showed full recovery after 72&#160;h highlighting the organisms without the microspheres, attached on body jellyfish surface around the mouth and lappets. In conclusion, short-term exposure to MP affects ephyrae jellyfish health, impairing both their survival and behavior. Polyethylene MP temporarily affect both Immobility and Frequency of pulsation of&#160;<i>Aurelia</i>&#160;sp. jellyfish. This study provides a first step towards understanding and clarifying the potential impacts of MP contamination in gelatinous zooplankton.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109983" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Recent advances in photonics technologies pushed optical microscopy toward new horizons in materials characterization. In this framework, Brillouin microscopy emerged as an innovative method to provide images of materials with mechanical contrast without any physical contact, but exploiting the light-matter interaction. Brillouin imaging holds great promise: to allow mechanical analysis inside soft and heterogeneous materials, addressing the pivotal role played by viscoelastic properties in the physiology and pathology of living tissues and cells. Nevertheless, extending the approach of Brillouin imaging to characterize elastic heterogeneities of micro- and nanostructured samples is especially challenging, and it poses a critical question about the actual spatial resolution reachable in the mechanical characterization. We focus this critical review on the key quantities that define the spatial resolution in the Brillouin scattering process, and we highlight that not only the optical focalization of the light, but also the acoustic excitations present in the material influence the information collected from a sample by Brillouin imaging. Referring to the body of knowledge gained in the field of material science, we review new results and recently obtained progresses in the more unexplored context of life science. In future developments, a comprehensive strategy to tackle both the acoustic and the optical aspects of the measurement will be required to maximize the efficacy of the technique.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.0c00801" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>There is a pressing clinical need to develop cell-based bone therapies due to a lack of viable, autologous bone grafts and a growing demand for bone grafts in musculoskeletal surgery. Such therapies can be tissue engineered and cellular, such as osteoblasts, combined with a material scaffold. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are both available and fast growing compared to mature osteoblasts, therapies that utilize these progenitor cells are particularly promising. We have developed a nanovibrational bioreactor that can convert MSCs into bone-forming osteoblasts in two- and three-dimensional, but the mechanisms involved in this osteoinduction process remain unclear. Here, to elucidate this mechanism, we use increasing vibrational amplitude, from 30 nm (N30) to 90 nm (N90) amplitudes at 1000 Hz and assess MSC metabolite, gene, and protein changes. These approaches reveal that dose-dependent changes occur in MSCs&#8217; responses to increased vibrational amplitude, particularly in adhesion and mechanosensitive ion channel expression and that energetic metabolic pathways are activated, leading to low-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to low-level inflammation as well as to ROS- and inflammation-balancing pathways. These events are analogous to those that occur in the natural bone-healing processes. We have also developed a tissue engineered MSC-laden scaffold designed using cells&#8217; mechanical memory, driven by the stronger N90 stimulation. These mechanistic insights and cell-scaffold design are underpinned by a process that is free of inductive chemicals.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03130" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>It has been established that the mechanical properties of hydrogels control the fate of (stem) cells. However, despite its importance, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between gels' stiffness and cell behavior is still missing from literature. In this work, the viscoelastic properties of poly(ethylene&#8208;glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogels are investigated by means of rheological measurements performed at different length scales. The outcomes of this work reveal that PEG&#8208;based hydrogels show significant stiffening when subjected to a compressional deformation, implying that conventional bulk rheology measurements may overestimate the stiffness of hydrogels by up to an order of magnitude. It is hypothesized that this apparent stiffening is caused by an induced &#8220;tensional state&#8221; of the gel network, due to the application of a compressional normal force during sample loading. Moreover, it is shown that the actual stiffness of the hydrogels is instead accurately determined by means of both passive&#8208;video&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking (PVPT) microrheology and nanoindentation measurements, which are inherently performed at the cell's length scale and in absence of any externally applied force in the case of PVPT. These results underpin a methodology for measuring hydrogels' linear viscoelastic properties that are representative of the mechanical constraints perceived by cells in 3D hydrogel cultures.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202000517" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <h3>Background</h3>
<p>The mechanical properties of single living cells have proven to be a powerful marker of the cell physiological state. The use of nanoindentation-based single cell force spectroscopy provided a wealth of information on the elasticity of cells, which is still largely to be exploited. The simplest model to describe cell mechanics is to treat them as a homogeneous elastic material and describe it in terms of the Young&#8217;s modulus. Beside its simplicity, this approach proved to be extremely informative, allowing to assess the potential of this physical indicator towards high throughput phenotyping in diagnostic and prognostic applications.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Here we propose an extension of this analysis to explicitly account for the properties of the actin cortex. We present a method, the Elasticity Spectra, to calculate the apparent stiffness of the cell as a function of the indentation depth and we suggest a simple phenomenological approach to measure the thickness and stiffness of the actin cortex, in addition to the standard Young&#8217;s modulus.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>The Elasticity Spectra approach is tested and validated on a set of cells treated with cytoskeleton-affecting drugs, showing the potential to extend the current representation of cell mechanics, without introducing a detailed and complex description of the intracellular structure.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-020-00706-2" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels are integral membrane proteins which play a crucial role in fast signaling during mechanosensory transduction processes in living cells. They are ubiquitous and old in the evolutionary sense, given their presence in cells from all three kingdoms of life found on Earth, including bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic organisms. As molecular transducers of mechanical force, MS channels are activated by mechanical stimuli exerted on cellular membranes, upon which they rapidly and efficiently convert these stimuli into electrical, osmotic, and/or chemical intracellular signals. Most of what we know about the gating mechanisms of MS channels comes from the work carried out on bacterial channels. However, recent progress resulting from identification and structural information of eukaryotic K2P-type TREK and TRAAK as well as Piezo1 and Piezo2 MS channels has greatly contributed to our understanding of the common biophysical principles underlying the gating mechanism and evolutionary origins of these fascinating membrane proteins. Using Piezo1 channels as an example, we briefly describe in this review what we have learned about their biophysics, physiological functions, and potential roles in &#8220;mechanopathologies.&#8221;</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-019-00584-5" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>A mechanical model of light propagation helps to show that optical refraction is related to the speed of light and how it changes from one medium to another. A tricycle toy robot is used to realize the model. Left and right wheels independently change their speed (high or low) in response to the local color (white or black, respectively) of the ground pattern detected by the corresponding optical sensor. Because of this simple rule the robot path deviates when passing, for example, from a clear to a dark area, in this way mimicking the refraction of a beam of light at an air&#8211;glass interface. Black silhouettes, representing optical components, are positioned on a clear mat along the robot trip. The robot trajectories reproduce phenomena such as refraction and total internal reflection showing a perfect analogy to light path described by geometrical optics in a sort of live ray-tracing.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6552/ab3e25" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>We propose a simple route to build up Fresnel bi-mirror microaxicons based on the localized absorption of an astigmatic pump laser beam by a plasmonic metal foil. The corresponding local overheating produces two main effects: the thermal swelling of the glass and the local increase of its refractive index. As a result, a two-mirrors axicon-like element coupled to a gradient index microlens is produced. We modelled the optothermal formation of this microelement by Finite Element Modeling and tested the predicted temperature raise by Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We calculated and measured the far field distribution of an impinging probe beam that passes through the lensed microaxicon, finding in both cases a noticeable change in the far field pattern when the pumping light is ON evidencing at the same time the good modulation capability of this opto-thermal element. A similar, even if smaller, effect was also found when the probe light impinges from the air side, where no gradient index region is present. This configuration allowed us to measure and confirm the theoretically expected angular deflection and, indirectly, the high value of the vertical thermomechanical deformation induced by the tight astigmatic focusing of the pump beam.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2019.2934583" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease often associated with overnutrition. Number and morphometry of lipid droplets (LDs) define micro&#160;<i>vs</i>&#160;macrovesicular steatosis, influence the morphology and function of hepatocytes and possibly their stiffness. The link between grade and features of steatosis and biomechanical properties of single hepatocytes requires deeper investigations.&#160;<i>In vitro</i>&#160;NAFLD models with distinct steatosis conditions were set by exposing FaO hepatoma cells to single or combined fructose (Fru), fatty acids (FA), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#945;. Single Cell Force Spectroscopy and Quantitative Phase Microscopy quantified the single cell stiffness and a series of morphometric parameters; the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism was quantified by real-time PCR. In our models, LD size and number increased with Fru and FA as single agents, and more with combined Fru/FA (macrovesicular steatosis), while FA/TNF&#945; combination increased LD number with a reduction in their size (microvesicular steatosis). We found that the changes in LD size and number influenced cell stiffness and morphometry as follows:&#160;<i>(i)</i>&#160;single cell elasticity increased in macrovesicular steatosis (maximally with combined Fru/FA);&#160;<i>(ii)</i>&#160;FA-induced steatosis resulted in cells thinner and larger, whereas combined FA/TNF&#945; shrunk the hepatocytes. Taken together the data on hepatocyte biomechanics show that, in addition to extent of lipid accumulation, cell stiffness is mainly influenced by LD size, while cell morphometry directly relates to LD number. Our findings suggest that a novel mechanobiology perspective might provide future contributions in NAFLD research.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.05.036" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>[...] We realized that technology developers, i.e. the engineers, and their adopters, the biologists and medical doctors, had very little occasions to meet and discuss at international congresses. Each category attended specialized meetings, where different scientific languages are spoken, further marking the divide.

Based on that dinner chat, Massimo had the brilliant idea of creating a venue where researchers in nanoengineering with interest in biological applications and biologists open to innovative technologies could meet, discuss and develop new ideas.

          <p>Human body is subject to many and variegated mechanical stimuli, actuated in different ranges of force, frequency, and duration. The process through which cells &#8220;feel&#8221; forces and convert them into biochemical cascades is called mechanotransduction. In this review, the effects of fluid shear stress on bone cells will be presented. After an introduction to present the major players in bone system, we describe&#160;the mechanoreceptors in bone tissue that can feel and process fluid flow. In the second part of the review, we present an overview of the biological processes and biochemical cascades initiated by fluid shear stress in bone cells.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-019-00596-1" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>
