          <p>A low-cost device for registration-free quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) based on the transport of intensity equation of cells in continuous flow is presented. The method uses acoustic focusing to align cells into a single plane where all cells move at a constant speed. The acoustic focusing plane is tilted with respect to the microscope&#8217;s focal plane in order to obtain cell images at multiple focal positions. As the cells are displaced at constant speed, phase maps can be generated without the need to segment and register individual objects. The proposed inclined geometry allows for the acquisition of a vertical stack without the need for any moving part, and it enables a cost-effective and robust implementation of QPM. The suitability of the solution for biological imaging is tested on blood samples, demonstrating the ability to recover the phase map of single red blood cells flowing through the microchip.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1063/5.0036585" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>Mesenchymal stem cells represent an important resource, for bone regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications. This review focuses on new advancements and biophysical tools which exploit different physical and chemical markers of mesenchymal stem cell populations, to finely characterize phenotype changes along their osteogenic differentiation process. Special attention is paid to recently developed label-free methods, which allow monitoring cell populations with minimal invasiveness. Among them, quantitative phase imaging, suitable for single-cell morphometric analysis, and nanoindentation, functional to cellular biomechanics investigation. Moreover, the pool of ion channels expressed in cells during differentiation is discussed, with particular interest for calcium homoeostasis. Altogether, a biophysical perspective of osteogenesis is proposed, offering a valuable tool for the assessment of the cell stage, but also suggesting potential physiological links between apparently independent phenomena.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-020-09569-7" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>There is a pressing clinical need to develop cell-based bone therapies due to a lack of viable, autologous bone grafts and a growing demand for bone grafts in musculoskeletal surgery. Such therapies can be tissue engineered and cellular, such as osteoblasts, combined with a material scaffold. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are both available and fast growing compared to mature osteoblasts, therapies that utilize these progenitor cells are particularly promising. We have developed a nanovibrational bioreactor that can convert MSCs into bone-forming osteoblasts in two- and three-dimensional, but the mechanisms involved in this osteoinduction process remain unclear. Here, to elucidate this mechanism, we use increasing vibrational amplitude, from 30 nm (N30) to 90 nm (N90) amplitudes at 1000 Hz and assess MSC metabolite, gene, and protein changes. These approaches reveal that dose-dependent changes occur in MSCs&#8217; responses to increased vibrational amplitude, particularly in adhesion and mechanosensitive ion channel expression and that energetic metabolic pathways are activated, leading to low-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to low-level inflammation as well as to ROS- and inflammation-balancing pathways. These events are analogous to those that occur in the natural bone-healing processes. We have also developed a tissue engineered MSC-laden scaffold designed using cells&#8217; mechanical memory, driven by the stronger N90 stimulation. These mechanistic insights and cell-scaffold design are underpinned by a process that is free of inductive chemicals.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03130" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <p>It has been established that the mechanical properties of hydrogels control the fate of (stem) cells. However, despite its importance, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between gels' stiffness and cell behavior is still missing from literature. In this work, the viscoelastic properties of poly(ethylene&#8208;glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogels are investigated by means of rheological measurements performed at different length scales. The outcomes of this work reveal that PEG&#8208;based hydrogels show significant stiffening when subjected to a compressional deformation, implying that conventional bulk rheology measurements may overestimate the stiffness of hydrogels by up to an order of magnitude. It is hypothesized that this apparent stiffening is caused by an induced &#8220;tensional state&#8221; of the gel network, due to the application of a compressional normal force during sample loading. Moreover, it is shown that the actual stiffness of the hydrogels is instead accurately determined by means of both passive&#8208;video&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking (PVPT) microrheology and nanoindentation measurements, which are inherently performed at the cell's length scale and in absence of any externally applied force in the case of PVPT. These results underpin a methodology for measuring hydrogels' linear viscoelastic properties that are representative of the mechanical constraints perceived by cells in 3D hydrogel cultures.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202000517" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>

          <h3>Background</h3>
<p>The mechanical properties of single living cells have proven to be a powerful marker of the cell physiological state. The use of nanoindentation-based single cell force spectroscopy provided a wealth of information on the elasticity of cells, which is still largely to be exploited. The simplest model to describe cell mechanics is to treat them as a homogeneous elastic material and describe it in terms of the Young&#8217;s modulus. Beside its simplicity, this approach proved to be extremely informative, allowing to assess the potential of this physical indicator towards high throughput phenotyping in diagnostic and prognostic applications.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Here we propose an extension of this analysis to explicitly account for the properties of the actin cortex. We present a method, the Elasticity Spectra, to calculate the apparent stiffness of the cell as a function of the indentation depth and we suggest a simple phenomenological approach to measure the thickness and stiffness of the actin cortex, in addition to the standard Young&#8217;s modulus.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>The Elasticity Spectra approach is tested and validated on a set of cells treated with cytoskeleton-affecting drugs, showing the potential to extend the current representation of cell mechanics, without introducing a detailed and complex description of the intracellular structure.</p> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-020-00706-2" target="_blank">access the full paper</a>
