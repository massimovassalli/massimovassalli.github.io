<h3 class="abstitle">Spontaneous symmetry breaking in cell migration</h3><div class="absauthor">Martial BALLAND</div><div class="absaffiliation">Physics, LIPHY CNRS/Grenoble University, Saint Martin d Heres (France)</div><div class="absmail">martial.balland@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr</div><div class="abstract">The ability of cells to migrate in a specific direction governs morphogenesis and homeostasis of functional tissues in multicellular species. Directional motility requires primarily an asymmetry in interaction forces between the cell and its environment, while preserving force balance. In absence of any external cue, several mechanisms of symmetry breaking have been proposed, mostly based on the spontaneous polarisation of cytoskeleton components, and a broad range of motile behaviors has been reported. However, the direct link between the dynamics of intracellular components and cellular forces exerted on the environment remains to be determined; in particular no direct measurements of the spatio-temporal coordination of both cellular parameters and force patterns have yet been reported. Using a uni-dimensional single cell migration assay compatible with force imaging, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking events in migrating cells. This analysis revealed a generic stick-slip motile behavior with stochastic initiation of directionality, occurring in absence of pre-established cytoskeleton polarity. While spreading, non polarized cells increase traction forces on the substrate, until the stochastic detachment of adhesive structures, inducing the subsequent creation of the cell rear and the initiation of migration. Hence cell migration is critically controlled by both the internal biochemical contractile machinery and the physical connections between cells and their microenvironment, and does not require cytoskeleton polarization. A theoretical model, consistent with quantitative experimental analysis of several cell types submitted to various physical or biochemical agents recapitulates the observed behaviors ranging from non polarized stochastic stick slip motion to polarized steady state migration. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Administration of miR-665 modulates cardiomyocyte mechanotransduction and prevents pathological card</h3><div class="absauthor">Luca BRAGA</div><div class="absaffiliation">Molecular Medicine, ICGEB, Trieste (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">braga@icgeb.org</div><div class="abstract">Luca Braga1, Matteo Dal Ferro1,3, Miguel Mano1, Ana Eulalio1, Antonio Cannatà3, Hashim Ali1, Consuelo Torrini1, Silvia Moimas1, Andrea Raso1, Lorena Zentilin1, Serena Zacchigna2 and Mauro Giacca1<br>

The adult heart is capable of remodelling in response to different pathological stimuli; in most cases, a phase of compensated hypertrophy evolves into frank dysfunction and heart failure. To identify microRNAs able to prevent cardiac hypertrophy, we performed a high content functional screening for human miRNAs able to reduce neonatal cardiomyocyte (CMs) cell size using a whole-genome miRNA library. The most effective anti-hypertrophic miRNAs in the screening was hsa-miR-665. In a model of transverse abdominal aortic constriction in 8 weeks old CD1 mice, AAV9-mediated delivery of miR-665 protected against pathological cardiac hypertrophy, preserved ejection fraction, avoided LV-dilation and prevented development of heart failure. This effect was observed both when the vectors were delivered before (LVEF at 60 day after TAC: 51.3±5.8% in treated vs. 34.82±0.77% in controls; P&lt;0.01) or after hypertrophy onset (LVEF at 60 days after TAC: 57.5±5.60% in treated vs. 28.4±15% in controls; P&lt;0.01). Global mRNAs changes in hearts treated with miR-665 were evaluated by mRNA deep sequencing. All the genes that were found to be expressed ≤2 fold over control were tested for being direct miR-665 targets. This approach identified three sarcomeric proteins namely Enah, Fhl1 and Xirp2, which are known to be involved in mechanotransduction and myofibrillar remodelling. In addition, hsa-miR-665 ameliorated LV passive stiffness in an AngII-mediated mouse model of HFpEF, supporting the conclusion that miR-665 modulates also CMs compliance to stretch.<br>
</div><h3 class="abstitle">Optical fibers &amp; MEMS for advanced mechanical characterization of cells, tissues and biomaterials</h3><div class="absauthor">Ernst BREEL</div><div class="absaffiliation">Life Science, Optics11, Amsterdam (Netherlands)</div><div class="absmail">ernst.breel@optics11.com</div><div class="abstract">Different approaches to mechanically characterize soft tissues and (bio)materials at different length-scales have been proposed to date, but a unique consensus on the optimal experimental and analysis method for obtaining physiologically relevant data for cell mechanobiology studies is still lacking. Several sample, testing and analysis variables can affect the measured sample mechanical properties (Mattei et al, Acta Biom 45:60-71, 2016). With the hypothesis that local mechanical characterization at typical cell length-scales in is critical to better characterize the biomechanical environment felt by cells in their native environment or when being cultured in-vitro, we here present the PIUMA as a tool to derive micro-mechanical properties via non-destructive nano-indentation measurements in liquids.<br>
The PIUMA features a fiber-optical fiber-top micro-machined force transducer, which offers unique advantages when performing measurements in liquids (Chavan et al, Rev Sci Instrum 83:115110, 2012). This opto-mechanical transducer is operated by a z-axis piezoelectric motor, whose closed-loop control has been recently modified to account for the actual cantilever bending during measurement, enabling load- and displacement-controlled user-defined experiments for a wide range of mechanical tests: from quasi-static experiments to derive elastic moduli, to step-response tests (e.g. creep, stress-relaxation), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and constant strain rate tests (i.e. nano-epsilon dot method, Mattei G et al, JMBBM 50:150-9, 2015) to characterize sample viscoelastic behavior – an aspect, the latter, which is becoming very important in cell mechanobiology (Chauduri et al, Nat Comm 6:6364, 2015).<br>
Applications to hydrogels, tissues and single cells will be presented. Moreover, we recently coupled MEMS fabrication techniques to probe production to extend the range of measurable mechanical properties including advanced cell compression and adhesion measurements.</div><h3 class="abstitle">Engineering viscoelasticity in biomaterials</h3><div class="absauthor">Ludovica CACOPARDO</div><div class="absaffiliation">Information Engineering - Research center 'Piaggio', University of Pisa, Pisa (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">ludovica.cacopardo@ing.unipi.it</div><div class="abstract">Tissues and biomaterials are generally characterised by a biphasic structure: a solid (elastic) network surrounded by an aqueous (viscous) solution. Despite the intrinsic viscoelasticity of these materials, most of the mechanobiology and tissue engineering studies in the literature are mainly focused on characterising elasticity and developing cell culture substrates with a given stiffness [Hoffman, 2012]. A few studies report on the modulation of biomaterial elasticity [Bhattacharya 2016; Shi 2007; Mensitieri 1996; Mattei 2017] using crosslinking strategies, which alter both elastic and viscous behaviour concomitantly. Therefore, our aim was to modulate material viscoelasticity by acting on the damping component, i.e. tuning the liquid phase viscosity of agarose and polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels by dissolving a constant amount of solid phase (1% w/v agarose, or 15,6% w/v acrylamide) in aqueous dextran solutions prepared at different concentrations (0, 2 and 5% w/v). Mechanical tests were performed following the epsilon-dot method [Tirella 2014], obtaining the instantaneous (Einst) and equilibrium (Eeq) elastic moduli, and the characteristic relaxation time (τ).<br>
Increasing the solvent viscosity resulted in a significant reduction Einst and of τ, while Eeq was found to be almost independent of the solvent viscosity. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the modulation of the liquid phase is reflected in the viscoelastic properties of the gels. The results showed also that this effect is more relevant in agarose, which presents a more elastic behaviour respect to PAAm. This suggest that the initial mechanical properties, but also the chemical behaviour, of the gels are a fundamental factor to modulate the viscoelasticity of a gel. This simple-yet-effective strategy might be beneficial to the field of mechanobiology, e.g. for studying cell response to substrate viscoelastic relaxation, while keeping the elastic cue (i.e. equilibrium modulus) constant.<br>

Emerging evidence indicates that mechanical cues such as the force applied or the rigidity of the extracellular matrix determine the shape and function of cells and organisms. Mechanotransduction, i.e., the conversion of mechanical forces into biochemical signals, is at the base of many biological processes fundamental for the development and differentiation of cells, for their correct function and for the development of pathologies. At the molecular scale, force modulates enzymatic activity, induces structural changes in proteins and nucleic acids, alters kinetics of molecular bonds, regulates motions of molecular motors, and has a role in mechanical transduction and sensory functions. <br>
Atomic force microscopes, optical tweezers, and magnetic tweezers have enabled the study of a wide range of molecular processes in which force plays a crucial role. However, they are usually inadequate to probe the dynamic interactions that occurs during transduction of mechanical signals on the millisecond and sub–millisecond time scale. We developed a constant-force laser trap that allows us to investigate molecular interactions and sub-nanometer conformational changes occurring on a time scale of few tens of microseconds. [Capitanio et al., Nature Methods 9, 1013-1019 (2012)]. The technique, named ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, has been applied to study load-dependent interactions between a biological polymer (DNA, actin, microtubules) and a binding protein. In this presentation, I will show implementation of our technique to the study of the mechanosensitivity of molecular motors, transcription factors during target search along DNA, and actin-binding proteins involved in mechanotransduction. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Physico-chemical regulation of viral nanoparticle uptake </h3><div class="absauthor">E. Ada CAVALCANTI-ADAM</div><div class="absaffiliation">Cellular Biophysics, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research and Heidelberg University, Heidelberg (Germany)</div><div class="absmail">ecavalcanti@mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de</div><div class="abstract">To gain entry into host cells, viruses have developed an exquisite tuning of their chemical and physical signatures. This entails the direct presentation or exposure of cell receptor binding sites on their surface, as well as a great variability in size and shape of viral particles. By combining live-cell microscopy and surface chemistry approaches with the development of biosensors for single molecule force measurements, we established a method to study the physical interaction of single viral particles with the cell surface. To determine the impact of particle size on clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), we use the same approach to immobilize nanoparticles having a diameter of 20 to 1000 nm. <br>
The critical diameter for inducing CME in a receptor independent manner is in the range of 100-300 nm, since only reoviruses (100 nm diameter) and nanoparticles of this size colocalize with clathrin-mediated structures. While the size of clathrin-mediated structures is determined by particle size, the further commitment that leads to CME is independent of cargo internalization. Further, the crucial steps for force generation are initiated by membrane bending depending on particle size, and do not rely on specific interactions with receptors at the cell surfaces and cytoskeletal forces. This suggests that a fine regulation of local, rather than global, physical events is crucial for virus uptake. Our studies provide the evidence that the early surface interactions of nanoscale objects with cells are essentially determined by a size-dependent change in membrane curvature that triggers internalization events.</div><h3 class="abstitle">Nanotopographies for neural contact guidance</h3><div class="absauthor">Marco CECCHINI</div><div class="absaffiliation">NEST, Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, NEST, Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, Pisa (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">marco.cecchini@nano.cnr.it</div><div class="abstract">-</div><h3 class="abstitle">Micro-Mapps: a phasor approach to the analysis of collagen

Due to its sensitivity to the incident polarization, it provides microstructural information otherwise unreachable by other intensity based imaging methods. B means of a Microscopic Multiparametric Analysis by Phasor projection of Polarization-dependent SHG (μMAPPS) we are able to map the features of the collagen architecture in tissues at the micrometer scale. <br>
μMAPPS is a fast, efficient approach that retrieves pixel-by-pixel the collagen fibrils anisotropy and orientation, avoiding direct fitting of the polarization dependent SHG signal. μMAPPS can be applied to study the collagen microscopic organization ex-vivo and in-vivo.

Recent work indicates that this is particularly significant for cells to correctly sense the mechanical properties of the microenvironment, and to respond by regulating the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators, which ultimately control cell behavior in response to mechanical cues. Yet, whether the connection between F-actin dynamics and YAP/TAZ signaling is relevant in mammalian tissues remains unaddressed. We will present data on a novel mouse knockout system enabling cell-autonomous regulation of F-actin dynamics and tissue mechanics, where we observe a potent upregulation of YAP/TAZ activity, leading to tissue hyperproliferation and organ overgrowth.

Although much effort has focused on cell-cell junctions, a role for physical confinement in collective cell migration has been recognized but not yet investigated. Here we show that the area of adhesion to the substrate is a key biophysical parameter that regulates lamellipodial protrusive forces, cell traction stresses, and consequently migrating cell velocity. Using adhesive microstripes to mimic the 2D confinement experienced by follower cells during epithelial sheet migration, we show that confined keratocytes displayed an elongated morphology with a similar cytoskeletal organization to that observed in follower cells, suggesting that adhesive area confinement alone is sufficient to lead to a reorganization of actin and microtubule networks without the need for intercellular adhesive cues. Normalization of migration velocity in cells moving on adhesive lines to their total adhesive area demonstrates that cell velocity is directly correlated to adhesive area. Closer examination revealed that adhesive area confinement reduces protrusive forces in the lamellipodium, decreases the number of focal complexes at the leading edge and prevents the formation of mature focal adhesions at the trailing edge required for retraction of the cell body. The combination of small protrusive forces in thick leading edges with low traction forces exerted at the trailing edge generate less effective forward propelling forces that lead to reduced migration velocities in confined cells. Additionally, adhesive microstripes offered an ideal environment for studying the dynamics underlying the escaping process of leader cells and to reveal the distinct roles of front and rear in this process. Together, these results identify substrate area confinement as a key determinant of the cell speed in collective migration. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Membrane tension: an universal mechanical signal for cell shape changes</h3><div class="absauthor">Nils GAUTHIER</div><div class="absaffiliation">Cell Biology, IFOM Institute FIRC Molecular Oncology, Milano (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">nils.gauthier@ifom.eu</div><div class="abstract">This seminar will focus on the role of the mechanical signal exerted by plasma membrane tension on cell shape changes.

At birth, over 30% of these cells still actively proliferate. However, only one week after birth this percentage drops to virtually null, and subsequent cardiac growth in the postnatal life occurs through cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, sustained by increase in cytoplasm size and build up of contractile sarcomeric structures. Physiological adaptation to stress as well as maladaptive adaptation to cardiomyocyte loss and dysfunction occurs through the modulation of levels, post-translational modification and regulation of activity of sarcomeric proteins and the associated microtubuli and microfilament networks. All these functions are in direct link to sensing extracellular tension generated by powerful mechanical forces exerted onto the myocardium. Multiple evidence now indicates that both cardiomyocyte proliferation and cytoskeletal/sarcomere function are under the control of the cellular microRNA network. I will present information on how our laboratory is unraveling the function of individual miRNAs and miRNA families involved in the regulation of cardiac cell proliferation and function by a functional approach using high throughput screenings of miRNA and siRNA whole genome libraries. The identification of the molecular pathways involved in cardiomyocyte replication, mechanosensing and hypertrophic growth has obvious implications in terms of generating new small drugs or nucleic acids able to foster cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction and to promote cardiac contractility in patients with heart failure. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Adaptive Nesting of Endothelial Cells in Honeycomb-Structured Biomedical Metasurfaces </h3><div class="absauthor">Costanza GIAMPIETRO</div><div class="absaffiliation">D-MAVT LTNT, ETH Zurich, Zurich (Switzerland)</div><div class="absmail">giampietro@ltnt.iet.mavt.ethz.ch</div><div class="abstract">The thrombogenicity of artificial materials comprising ventricular assist devices (VADs) limits their long-term integration in the human body.

However, even non-specialized cells including vascular cells can be activated by very subtle changes in blood flow or pressure and are also intrinsically mechanosensitive (Patel and Honoré, 2010). Although important progress was made with the early identification of the MscL and MscS channels in bacteria (Kung, 2005), DEG/ENaC channels in the nematode (Chalfie, 2009), TREK/TRAAK K2P channels in human cells (Honoré, 2007), the molecular basis for mammalian non-selective cationic mechanosensitive ion channels was only discovered in 2010 (Coste et al., 2010).

ATR is also known to regulate nuclear integrity by sensing mechanical stress at the nuclear envelope. We observe that depletion of ATR leads to nuclear deformations, abnormal chromosomal architecture, altered nuclear stiffness, defective nuclear mechanotransduction; collectively indicating loss of nuclear integrity and homeostasis. Consequently, due to defective nuclear dynamics, cells lacking ATR are defective in 2D migration and in 3D migration through constrictions due. Cancer cells with reduced ATR have decreased survival rate, fail to survive the circulation through the blood stream and to efficiently invade host organs. Recent reports have associated higher levels of ATR with severe phenotypes and more invasive cancers supporting our observation. In summary, we report a novel role of ATR in maintaining of nuclear integrity against mechanical and topological insults. We propose that ATR has duel role in tumorogenisis, as a tumor suppressor by maintaining genomic stability and as a facilitator of tumor progression by supporting cell survival in extreme mechano-environmental alterations.</div><h3 class="abstitle">Integrative approach to cell deformation, division and migration</h3><div class="absauthor">Caterina LA PORTA</div><div class="absaffiliation">Environmental Science and Policy, University of Milan, Milano (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">caterina.laporta@unimi.it</div><div class="abstract">We review our recent results related to the observation and modeling of cell deformation, division and migration [1].

Simulations of a model of fluid-mediated membrane-cortex deformations show that a permeable membrane is necessary for bleb formation which is otherwise impaired [2]. Next, we discuss two mechanical models for individual and multiple cell divisions: i) A three dimensional model of motor-driven chromosome congression and bi-orientation during mitosis revealing that successful cell division requires control of the total number of microtubules [3]. ii) A model for the division of stem cells in a crypt that relates stem cell population dynamics to the effect of mechanical forces acting on the spindle.

These mechanical stimuli are often essential to proper cell function, such as migration, proliferation, differentiation[1-4]. Cells sense such mechanical stimuli through a process called mechanotransduction [1, 5, 6]. Abnormal mechanotransduction leads to several patho-genesis, such as cancer, asthma, heart disease[1, 7, 8]. In Mechanobiology studies, the advance of in vitro technologies for the application of physiologically mimicking mechanical force to cultured cells and tissue are vital due to the complex in vivo biological system. The growing interest in Mechanobiology and technology gap have motivated the development of cell stretching device in various research labs and companies [10]. However, most cell stretching systems are bulky and limited in functions. In particular, there is no cell culture chamber/dish capable of multifunctional cell stretching. A novel cell stretching device in the size of a cell culture petri dish has been invented, which is called cell stretching dish. It is capable of uniaxial as well as biaxial stretching. The cell stretching dish is characterized by high level of stretching, which can reach up to 100% (and more). It is portable and easy to be used for both cell culture and microscope imaging experiment. The device has been tested to be compatible with the high resolution objectives, for live cell as well as fixed cell immunofluorescence imaging, and can be scaled up and down to fit any inverted microscope. The device can be 3D printed or made from plastic, thus further reducing the cost of production, bringing down the complicated cell stretching system to the consumable level. The unique design, high level stretch, cheap cost will open variety of possibilities not only to researchers in mechanobiology but also broad field of biologist.</div><h3 class="abstitle">Nuclear polarity: does it exist?</h3><div class="absauthor">Paolo MAIURI</div><div class="absaffiliation">//, IFOM Institute FIRC Molecular Oncology, Milano (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">paolo.maiuri@ifom.eu</div><div class="abstract">The spatiotemporal organization of the eukaryotic genome is dynamic and contributes to the regulation of gene expression, but how does it respond to the changes of cell morphology is an unexplored area of research. <br>
To study the interplay between cell architecture and nuclear organization we are combining tools typical of experimental biophysics, like image analysis and micro-patterning, with chromosome painting. Micro-patterning of adhesive molecules is a powerful technique that, by specifically defining the available area of spreading for a cell, allows to control its geometry. Chromosome painting enables instead to visualize chromosomes in the nucleus. Combining these two techniques, we can measure the positioning of a chromosome in the nucleus of cells with a determined geometry. <br>
Our preliminary results suggest that imposing to cells an asymmetric shape, like a teardrop, which mimics a polarized state, generates an asymmetric distribution of chromosomes along the axis of symmetry. Some chromosomes are indeed more frequently positioned towards the front of the cell, the curved part of the teardrop, while some others are more frequently found close to the back. Similarly, when cells are plated on lines, a geometry previously used to study cell migration, an asymmetric distribution of chromosomes along the “nucleus to Golgi” axis of polarity is observed.<br>
Forces and flows are necessary to maintain a specific geometry or to move. Is a portion of this tension/dynamics somehow transmitted to the genome affecting its spatial organization?<br>

Integral membrane proteins are sensitive to changes of their bilayer environment such that their activities and localization can be profoundly affected. When incorporated into phospholipids of mammalian cells, poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) determine the mechanical properties of the bilayer thereby affecting several membrane associated functions such as endo- and exo-cytosis and ion channel/membrane receptor signalling cascades. In order to understand how membrane tension is propagated through polyunsaturated bilayers, we characterized the effect of lipid saturation on liposome reconstituted MscS and MscL, the two bacterial mechanosensitive ion channels that have for many years served as models of ion- channel-mediated mechanotransduction. The combination of NMR and patch clamp experiments in this study demonstrate that bilayer thinning is the main responsible factor for the modulation of the MscL threshold of activation while a change in transbilayer pressure profile is indicated as the main factor behind the observed modulation of the MscS kinetics. Together, our data offer a novel insight into how the structural shape differences between the two types of mechanosensitive channels determine their differential modulation by poly-unsaturated phospholipids and thus lay the foundation for future functional studies of eukaryotic ion channels involved in the physiology of mechanosensory transduction processes in mammalian cells. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Study Of Invasive Gliomas: Mechanoproperties And Molecular Machineries</h3><div class="absauthor">Pascale MONZO</div><div class="absaffiliation">Cell Biology, IFOM Institute FIRC Molecular Oncology, Milano (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">pascale.monzo@gmail.com</div><div class="abstract">Glioblastomas are extremely aggressive brain tumors with a very pour outcome, mostly due to the fact that these tumors are exceptionally invasive, penetrating into deep regions of the brain and destroying neurons leading to the rapid death of the patient (typically 10-14months). They migrate mostly by following linear brain blood vessel surface, using a saltatory linear migration mode. This type of linear migration can be recapitulated in vitro using micropatterning or electrospun fibers. We have previously shown using the rat C6 glioma cell model, that the mechanical confinement of glioma cells using micropattern and/ or increasing their cell density triggers a linear migration mode which is dependent on formins but not on Arp2/3. Specifically we have found that the formin FHOD3 was involved in this motility. In the present work we investigated the mechanical properties of glioma stem cell isolated from patients. We used micropatterns and electropsun fibers to analyze their motility and adhesive properties. We also evaluated the formin expression levels present in these cells and found that in addition to FHOD3, other formins have roles in mediating linear migration of these cells.</div><h3 class="abstitle">STEM CELL – BIOMATERIAL INTERACTION: A MATTER OF MACHANOTRANSDUCTION</h3><div class="absauthor">Francesco MORENA</div><div class="absaffiliation">Chemistry, Biology and Biotechnologies, University of Perugia, Perugia (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">effemorena@gmail.com</div><div class="abstract">It is a general concern that mechanical forces, such as gravity, tension, compression, hydrostatic pressure, govern the cell growth and shape within tissues and organs under physiological and pathological conditions. Additionally, traction forces generated by cells may markedly influence many biological processes such as the stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. The hypothesis is that stem cells sense the mechanical loading through a diverse group of membrane-anchored mechanosensors (e.g. stretch-activated ion channels, integrins). These mechanical stimuli are then converted to biochemical signals by triggering a step-by-step activation of downstream signaling involving the cytoskeleton and the nucleoskeleton components. The convergence of these pathways results in the expression of a gene profile that direct the stem cells fate.<br>
Hence, elucidating mechanotransduction pathways may shed light to complex biological phenomena such as the stem cells' specification and determination processes and developmental behaviors. <br>
With this aim, we have explored the mechanotransduction axes in ex vivo tissue engineering modeling generated by combining different types of stem cells and biomaterials under growth culture condition. The latter, allows to provide informative microenvironments mimicking a physiological niche, allowing stem cells to interpret the biomaterial instructions and modify their fate accordingly. <br>

Here, the Fucci2 reporter was transfected in various human epithelial cancer cells to resolve their cell cycle phase transition. The corresponding tractions were captured by means of a recently developed, reference-free, confocal traction force microscopy (cTFM) platform. The combined approach was conducive to the analysis of phase-dependent force variation at the level of individual integrin contacts. Detected forces were invariably higher in the G1 and early S phases as compared to the ensuing late S/G2, and locally co-localized with high levels of paxillin phosphorylation. The biochemical inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) reduced paxillin phosphorylation and significantly diminished the force transmitted to the substrate. These data demonstrate a reproducible modulation of force transmission during the cell cycle progression of cancer cells.

As an attractive alternative, deformability cytometry exploits cell mechanics as a sensitive, inherent, label-free functional marker, but lacks the specificity provided by a fluorescent signal. Here we present real-time fluorescence and deformability cytometry (RT-FDC), the ideal, combined system. It facilitates fluorescence detection as in conventional flow cytometry, extended by 1D analysis of spatial information encoded in the fluorescence pulse shape, and adds bright field imaging for mechanical phenotyping of single cells - all in real-time at rates of 100 cells/s. We show utility of RT-FDC for the most common fluorescent labels: Fluorescent surface markers (CD34) are used to separate human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from an unpurified apheresis sample as harvested for bone marrow transplantations. Membrane permeant dyes identify reticulocytes by their ribonucleic acid (RNA) content in a blood sample. And endogenously expressed fluorescent proteins (FUCCI) reveal cell cycle phases in an unsynchronized sample of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE1).

An emerging theoretical framework to interpret and integrate these interactions in unifying principles is the notion of cell jamming. During collective motility cells can flow like a fluid, but as density rises, the motion of each cell is constrained by the crowding due to its neighbors, forcing them to move in groups. At a critical density, motility ceases and collectives rigidify undergoing a liquid (unjammed)-to-solid (jammed) transition, herein referred to as UJT. This transition is thought to ensure proper development of barrier properties in epithelial tissues, but also to act as a tumor suppressive mechanism. The reverse, JUT might, instead, represent an alternative gateway to cell migration, enabling tissues to escape the caging imposed by the crowded cellular landscape of mature epithelia. The general validity of this physical framework and of JUT, however, remains to be verified. Even less understood is how cells control such phase transitions. <br>

B cells play a critical role in immune responses by producing antibodies against the foreign pathogens that they encounter. Their responses are initiated when the B cell receptor binds antigen displayed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell in a cell-cell contact called the immune synapse. This binding event triggers the B cell to internalize, process, and present the antigen to helper T cells, which are required for full B cell activation and clonal selection. High-affinity B cells receive more T cell help than low-affinity B cells do, suggesting that affinity discrimination during antigen internalization is essential for high-affinity antibody responses. The mechanisms of antigen recognition, discrimination, and uptake remain a topic of debate, with physical extraction through mechanical forces and enzymatic liberation through lysosome secretion proposed as efficient ways for B cells to acquire antigen. To investigate B cell extraction mechanisms, we developed DNA-based nanosensors to interrogate antigen extraction from both artificial substrates and live antigen-presenting cells. We show that B cells acquire antigen primarily through mechanical force, and resort to enzymatic liberation only if force-dependent extraction fails. The use of mechanical force renders B cells sensitive to physical properties of the antigen-presenting cell. We find that stiff antigen-presenting cells promote strong B cell pulling forces and stringent affinity discrimination, while flexible antigen-presenting cells allow B cells to extract low-affinity antigen using weak forces. Thus, mechanical properties of the immune synapse regulate B cell antigen extraction, suggesting that distinct physical properties of antigen-presenting cells support different stages of B cell responses. <br>

Abstract<br>
To identify the critical regulators in the process of cardiomyocyte de-differentiation that parallels cell proliferation, we performed a targeted RNAi screen based on high-content fluorescence microscopy, using a library of ~600 siRNAs against factors in the ubiquitin-conjugation and proteasome-mediated degradation pathway; screening endpoint was the incorporation of EdU in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes; validation of hits was later performed testing phospho-histone 3 positivity and Aurora B kinase localization in midbodies during cytokinesis. Using a 2 fold-standard deviation threshold over control for EdU incorporation, we identified 6 siRNAs that stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and 10 siRNAs that inhibit it. Most of these siRNAs target cellular E3-ubiquitin ligases with still unidentified targets in cardiac biology. In particular, we found that depletion of the TRIM family member TRIM35 was able to markedly induce proliferation of both mouse and rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac-specific deletion of the TRIM35 gene in vivo using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology delivered through AAV vectors induced remarkable proliferation in the hearts of neonatal mice. Gene knock out in adult mice improved heart function and decreased fibrosis after myocardial infarction. <br>
In conclusion: TRIM35 is a novel ubiquitin-conjugation component restricting cardiac regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. <br>

In order to increase and supplement the information gained from nanoindentation experiments, the FIEL method was extended to obtain the "Elastography" of the sample, computing stiffness trend depending on the indentation depth. This method allowed to identify different stiffness layers putatively associated with inner components and compartments of the cell. This approach was applied to FAO cells, a differentiated rat hepatoma cell line treated to mimic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Tracking and imaging in acoustophoresis devices by holographic microscopy</h3><div class="absauthor">Teresa CACACE</div><div class="absaffiliation">Mathematics and Physics Department, University of Campania L.Vanvitelli, Caserta (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">t.cacace@isasi.cnr.it</div><div class="abstract">Particle and bio-particles manipulation in microfluidic environment is a topic of growing relevance in the scientific community, in response to the rapid development of biochips, miniaturized analysis systems or lab-on-a-chip devices. In particular, acoustophoresis exploits ultrasounds to manipulate micro-sized objects. Being a non-contact and label free technique, it is especially suited to handle biological samples.<br>
However, its diffusion outside the laboratories depends on the ability to monitor experimentally the manipulation effectiveness and stability.<br>
To this end, commonly employed techniques rely on quantitative analysis of video microscopy images. However, observing three-dimensional trajectories of particles is in general a challenging task in classical microscopy, solved only by extensive calibration procedures or cumbersome analysis.<br>
 Those limitations can be surmounted employing digital holographic microscopy. This full-field and label-free imaging technique allows the accurate 3D tracking of multiple targets in the field of view.   At the same time, it provides quantitative phase-contrast information, fitting perfectly in the emergent field of acoustic based microfluidics for cells manipulation.<br>
We demonstrate the use of DH to monitor the 3D motion of particles manipulated by ultrasound standing waves. The full 3D tracking is implemented combining automatic numerical refocusing - a feature characteristic of DH - and 2D tracking algorithms.<br>
Besides tracking, DH can display its full potential when imaging transparent samples, such as cells. In this case, further numerical processing can provide additional information on the sample morphology, with potential applications in the field of diagnostic. <br>

We have designed and characterised an acoustofluidic bioreactor platform, which applies acoustic forces to mechanically stimulate aggregates of human articular chondrocytes in long-term levitated culture. By varying the acoustic parameters (amplitude, frequency sweep, and sweep repetition rate), cells were stimulated by oscillatory fluid shear stresses, which were dynamically modulated at different sweep repetition rates (1–50 Hz). The acoustic stimulation was tuned to engineer human cartilage constructs with structural and mechanical properties comparable to those of native human cartilage, as assessed by immunohistology and nano-indentation, respectively.

Directional motility requires primarily an asymmetry in interaction forces between the cell and its environment, while preserving force balance. In absence of any external cue, several mechanisms of symmetry breaking have been proposed, mostly based on the spontaneous polarization of cytoskeleton components. In particular the role of physico-chemical properties of the environment has been highlighted. However, the direct link between the dynamics of intracellular components and cellular forces exerted on the environment remains to be determined. Up until now, no direct measurements of the spatio-temporal coordination of both cellular parameters and force patterns have yet been reported. Using a uni-dimensional single cell migration assay compatible with force imaging, quantitative microscopy and optogenetics, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking events of both cell morphological parameters and force patterns in migrating cells. This analysis revealed a generic stick-slip motile behavior. The initiation of migration depends on stochastic detachment of adhesions in the rear and occurs in absence of pre-established cytoskeleton polarity.  Transient local RhoA optogenetic activation allowed the controlled induction of detachment events, validating the central role of adhesion dynamics in the initiation of back-front polarity of migrating cells. Hence, cell migration is critically controlled by both the internal biochemical contractile machinery and the physical connections between cells and their microenvironment, and does not require a pre-existing cytoskeleton polarization. A theoretical model, consistent with quantitative experimental analysis of several cell types, recapitulates the observed behaviors ranging from non-polarized stochastic stick slip motion to polarized steady state migration. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Cell properties influencing jamming and unjamming behavior in epithelial monolayer</h3><div class="absauthor">Sophie LOHMANN</div><div class="absaffiliation">D-MAVT LTNT, ETH Zurich, Zurich (Switzerland)</div><div class="absmail">slohmann@ethz.ch</div><div class="abstract">Differentiated epithelial layers in the human body generate a continuous barrier that lines the inner and outer surface of all and body cavities, including the luminal side of blood and lymphatic vessels. In quiescent epithelia, each constituent cell performs its function while anchored to the local basal matrix and to the neighboring cells, and therefore with relatively little movements. However, epithelial cells retain the ability to migrate to great distances, which can be unleashed by a breach in the monolayer continuity as in wound healing.  When epithelial cells in a confluent monolayer migrate, they do it as a collective, moving in a coordinated and coherent fashion. The emergence of collective migration is orchestrated by several physical and molecular factors with complex interactions. Among them, the shape factor of a cell, defined as the ratio between the perimeter and the square root of the area of the cell, can influence its motility and plays a key factor in determining the jammed or unjammed state of the entire monolayer. Moreover mechanotransduction, a mechanism through which cells sense mechanical forces and convert them into biological responses, takes place when the monolayer is confined in areas of different geometries. In case of fluid-like motion of the monolayer, coordinate patterns of motion appear and change depending on the different shapes of this constraining regions. <br>
The study of the monolayer as a collective and the interactions that occur between the cells when these two factors are combined can lead to a better understanding of all the mechanisms taking part during the collective motion.<br>

In fact, the physical shape of anisotropic nanostructures induces alignment or directional growth of cells, the contact guidance phenomenon. The micro-environment coexist, in vivo, with some degree of topographic noise due to cellular debris or scar-tissue invasion. Previous studies have enlightened the impact of a controlled amount of topographical noise on neurite guidance of PC12 cells. Contact guidance is also a strong regulator of collective directional migration, which could be driven by single, or combination of external cues such as chemical gradients (chemotaxis) or gradients of substrate stiffness (durotaxis). In particular, collective durotaxis has recently emerged as a far more efficient mechanism than single-cell one. Here we present a fibroblast and epithelial cell motility study as single cell on topographical gradients. </div><h3 class="abstitle">Pathophysiological micro-mechanical viscoelasticity of developing, aged and infarcted myocardium</h3><div class="absauthor">Giorgio MATTEI</div><div class="absaffiliation">Research and Development, Optics11 B.V., Amsterdam (Netherlands)</div><div class="absmail">giorgio.mattei@optics11.com</div><div class="abstract">Mechanical properties are critical in regulating pathophysiological cell behavior during tissue development, ageing and disease via mechano-transduction (Mammoto et al, Ann Rev Cell Dev Biol 29:27-61, 2013). Although biological tissues are generally regarded as viscoelastic, to date most of the mechanobiology studies focused on characterizing tissue elasticity and investigating cell behavior as a function of substrate stiffness. Moreover, mechanical properties are often derived using bulk testing techniques, unsuitable for investigating the local biomechanical environment felt by cells (Mattei et al, Acta Biom 45:60-71, 2016). In this work, a new approach combining a customized PIUMA Nanoindenter (Optics11) with the nano-epsilon dot method (Mattei et al, JMBBM 50:150-9, 2015) was used to characterize the micro-mechanical viscoelastic properties of developing, ageing and infarcted myocardium at typical cell length-scales in physiological-like conditions. <br>
Dynamic nano-indentation measurements were performed at 5 different strain rates (0.01 ÷ 0.25 s-1) in liquid (PBS 1x) at controlled temperature (37 °C) on both healthy (embryonic day E15, E18.5; month 3, 4, 10, 20) and 3 months old infarcted murine myocardial samples. <br>
Tissue stiffening and a viscoelastic transition towards a more elastic behavior were observed with ageing (up to 3 months) and after infarction. Surprisingly, ageing from month 4 to 20 resulted in tissue softening and viscoelastic shift backwards to viscous behavior, probably due to changes in cell and/or tissue composition.<br>
Our findings provide new insights into the micro-mechanical viscoelastic properties sensed by cells in developing, ageing and infarcted myocardium, which are critical to better understand cell-ECM interactions and mechano-transduction, with potential implications in biomaterial design, tissue engineering, disease modelling and cell mechanobiology studies. <br>

Moreover, these barriers have a fundamental role in the control of absorption of substances and the maintenance of the homeostasis of the different body compartments. For these reasons, the study of biological barriers is crucial not only for a better understanding of their physiology and pathology, but also in drug testing and toxicology studies. The simplest in vitro model of physiological barriers is based on cells grown on a transwell (two compartments divided by a permeable support), maintained in static conditions within traditional multiwell plates. However, several recent studies are focused on the implementation of more relevant models able to provide cells with an appropriate pattern of physical and chemical stimuli that better reproduce the physiological environment. Therefore, barrier-forming cells are often cultured in fluidic systems (bioreactors) able to apply dynamic conditions [1]. The main actor of these systems is the porous membrane. This surface is a permeable support for the cultured cell layer, thus the material must be biocompatible and cell adhesive. In this work I investigated electrospun membranes obtained by coupling poly(carbonate)urethane (Bionate® II 80A) conjugated with gelatin at different percentage (Bionate®:Gelatin at 50:50, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10, 100:0). Varying the amount of gelatin, it was possible to obtain membranes with different stiffness and elasticity, allowing mimicking different type of physiological barriers and different pathological conditions. The electrospinning technique was chosen to obtain porous membranes, while Bionate®’s flexibility allows mimicking the cyclic stretching of barriers in the human body (i.e. alveolar barrier during breathing).</div><h3 class="abstitle">Automation of the FluidFM Technology for Microinjection in Mammalian Cells</h3><div class="absauthor">Dario OSSOLA</div><div class="absaffiliation">Support and Product Management, Cytosurge AG, Zurich (Switzerland)</div><div class="absmail">dario.ossola@cytosurge.com</div><div class="abstract">Microinjection of exogenous material is a powerful tool to address many biological issues, from the fundamental understanding of intracellular processes to drug development. However, current technologies are usually time consuming, require laborious handling and are often not efficient enough both in terms of throughput and cell survival rate. This is also usually limited to large cells like oocytes.<br>
FluidFM technology, a combination of atomic force microscopy and microfluidics, among other applications, has already been shown to be able to perform microinjection in a cell-context preserving and non-destructive manner. Here, we developed an automatized system, called the FluidFM BOT, which allows FluidFM microinjection to be performed at higher throughput levels into adherent cells. We could inject up to 200 cells per hour with Lucifer Yellow dye. Interestingly, we could demonstrate the ability of the FluidFM technology to microinject various cell types in a cell-context preserving manner. We also show here the ability of the system to inject proteins – such as Cas9 protein – or RNA molecules.<br>
Using the remarkable reproducibility in FluidFM nanosyringe fabrication, we also present a protocol to precisely measure the injected volume: an important parameter, for example, when determining dose-response relationship. Moreover, the capacity to achieve non-destructive cytosolic extraction (already demonstrated with FluidFM technology on an AFM system) is now under investigation on the FluidFM BOT system aiming to higher throughput, reproducibility and integration in standard biolab workflows.<br>
Preliminary results are shown demonstrating feasibility. In conclusion, the recently developed FluidFM BOT system offers biologists an entirely new approach to solve problems from drug development to genetic studies.</div><h3 class="abstitle">Jamming to unjamming transition in 3D systems</h3><div class="absauthor">Andrea PALAMIDESSI</div><div class="absaffiliation">Mechanisms of Tumor Cell Migration, IFOM Institute FIRC Molecular Oncology, Milan (Italy)</div><div class="absmail">andrea.palamidessi@ifom.eu</div><div class="abstract">Collective cell migration, a widely recognized mode of migration during embryogenesis, wound repair and cancer, refers to the process of many cells migrating as a cohesive group with each individual cell correlating its own movement with that of its neighbors.<br>
A cellular process that influences different aspects of cellular and multicellular plasticity and collective motility strategies is membrane trafficking. This process is controlled by a myriad of different proteins.  However, the small GTPases of the RAB family have emerged as critical trafficking nodes between the different stations of the endocytic pathway. <br>
We found that endocytic circuitries controlled by RAB5A, a key regulator of early endosomes necessary to promote a proteolytic, mesenchymal program of individual cancer cell invasion, have a dramatic impact on the mechanics and dynamics of multicellular, normal and tumorigenic, cell assemblies. Perturbations of RAB5A levels are sufficient to re-awaken the motility of otherwise solid-like and kinetically arrested, jammed monolayers.<br>
We observed the same transition, from static to dynamic state that promote coherent angular motion in different 3D cellular systems, and specifically both in mitotic arrested, jammed MCF10A- acini and in 3D MCF10.DCIS-tumor spheroids embedded in stiff collagen matrix. <br>
We additional found that the reawakening of circular angular motion in 3D spheroids correlates with the ability of individual cells to escape the cage imposed by 3D confinement at short time scale, while it promotes matrix remodelling and collective invasion at longer time scale.<br>
Thus, the acquisition of fluid-like features linked to unjamming may promote an alternative or complementary strategy with respect to canonical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition for cell dissemination and distal metastasis formation.<br>

In our previous works we developed alginate ultra-soft hydrogels to support the formation of 3D neural networks. This feature was mainly attributed to the physico-mechanical properties of the alginate mesh at low cross-linking density. However in this condition, most of the carboxylic groups are free from ionic bonds and may be available for binding cell membrane proteins. Such cell-sugar interaction is known to occur in mammals where the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) interacts with the cell receptor CD44. Here for the first time we speculate that alginate can be recognized by the cells in place of hyaluronan and exert a biological function. For this study we used mes-c-myc A1 immortalized cells derived from murine embryonic mesencephalon and expressing CD44. In presence of alginate as soluble factor, these cells extended long neurites, showed reduced protein levels of markers typical of stem cells (Sox2 and 8H4), astrocytes (GFAP), and oligodendrocytes (Olig2), while they expressed high levels of the neural markers Neurofilament H-M, β3 tubulin and MAP2. On the other hand, in silico molecular docking suggested that alginate and HA bound CD44 in two different yet close pockets. In parallel, preliminary data of in vitro molecule interaction indicated that alginate could effectively bind CD44. Overall, these findings show that alginate boosts neural differentiation, likely through the mechano-receptor CD44. Further investigations in vitro and in cellular systems are required to unravel the bio-mechanical nature of cell alginate interaction. We envision that this discovery will cause a shift in the use of alginate from inert material towards a bioactive matrix with which cells can effectively interact and build a realistic tissue, with profound impact on regenerative medicine</div><h3 class="abstitle">Cell properties influencing jamming and unjamming behavior in epithelial monolayer</h3><div class="absauthor">Francesca Michela PRAMOTTON</div><div class="absaffiliation">D-MAVT LTNT, ETH Zurich, Zurich (Switzerland)</div><div class="absmail">fpramott@ethz.ch</div><div class="abstract">Differentiated epithelial layers in the human body generate a continuous barrier that lines the inner and outer surface of all and body cavities, including the luminal side of blood and lymphatic vessels.

The aim of this project is to develop a robust technique to calculate the nuclear/cell volume ratio in homeostasis, investigating its variation during the cell cycle. To accurately measure the cell volume, a recently optimized fluorescence exclusion technique has been used in combination with a microfluidic device fabricated by soft-lithography consisting of a chamber with a well-defined depth. Cells are seeded inside the chamber filled with a fluorescent dye (dextran-GFP), unable to penetrate the cell membrane. The presence of a cell determines a decrease in the fluorescence proportional to its own volume. Pillars of known depth are introduced into the chamber to calibrate the system and convert the fluorescence intensity into cell height. The cell volume is then obtained by area integration. The same principle is applied to measure the nuclear volume. The cytoplasm is filled with a fluorescent protein (5xmCherry), unable to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex due to its size and the presence of the nuclear export signals in the designed construct. The preliminary results showed that both signals were exclusively localized in the chamber and in the cytoplasm. Real-time images at a low-magnification objective are acquired, allowing to quantify the dynamic volumes of individual cells in large cell populations. This technique has the potential to be used for a broad variety of cells, and therefore it represents a valuable tool for the comparative study of normal and cancer cell presenting alterations of the nuclear shape and size.</div>
